# Krystal's Modded Material Compats
## Intertwining materials from different mods.

### Overview
Ever wanted Thermal styled gears for that one random metal in that mod you play with? Or maybe Create styled sheets for Tinkering with? Look no more! I aim to add much different compatibility metal items mainly for modpack makers.

### Extra Info
The style of this mod will stay shifted towards mods with a cleaner, more modern art style.

Builtin resourcepacks will be included with the mod to retexture some items like the Create style sheets or Thermal styled dusts to match the textures from mods like Immersive Engineering.
